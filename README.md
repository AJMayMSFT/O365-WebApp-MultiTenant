O365-WebApp-MultiTenant
=======================

This sample shows how to build an MVC web application that uses Azure AD for sign-in using the OpenID Connect protocol, and then calls a Office 365 API under the signed-in user's identity using tokens obtained via OAuth 2.0. This sample uses the OpenID Connect ASP.Net OWIN middleware and ADAL .Net.
